I want to show how this person looks wearing a {PRODUCT_CLOTHES} in {PRODUCT_COLOR} color. 

Analyze the person in the photo and identify which piece of clothing should be replaced to make this try-on realistic. Return the type and color of the clothing item that would make sense to replace.

For example:
- If trying on a jacket, identify the person's current jacket/outerwear
- If trying on a shirt, identify the person's current shirt/top
- If trying on shoes, identify the person's current footwear

Describe the clothing to replace like this:
{
  "clothes": "<<ADD>>",
  "color": "<<ADD>>"
}

Examples:
{
  "clothes": "shirt",
  "color": "blue"
}
{
  "clothes": "jacket", 
  "color": "black"
}
{
  "clothes": "shoes",
  "color": "white"
}
